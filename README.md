A serverless comment engine designed for statically generated blogs (Hugo, Jekyll). It is designed to be hosted in AWS.

I was disappointed in the existing services available. It seems that there are currently 3 choices:
 
 - Disqus: ad-supported or fixed subscription
 - Commento: requires a server
 - Utterances: commenters require GitHub
 
A serverless architecture allows for a pay-for-what-you-use payment model. For most small blogs, especially those just starting
out, this is likely to be more cost-effective than a subscription.
